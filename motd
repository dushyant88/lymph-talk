Welcome to the lymph demo playground.

You can play around with lymph demo services and explore the tooling. There are
prepared tmux sessions. To get started, list the available sessions:

  $ mux list

Choose one of them and start it, e.g.:

  $ mux start all

(Tmux' prefix is changed to be C-w. You move between panes like in vim.)

You will find yourself inside a tmux session with panes set up and services
running. If in doubt, run:

  $ lymph list
